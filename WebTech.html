<h1>Web Technology</h1>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
    browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
    JavaScript.</p>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
    web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
    of the document.</p>
<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce
    content into the page. Other tags such as
<p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in
    a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.[2]</p>
<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
    presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
    separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
    be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
<h3>JS</h3>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
    technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client
    side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
    dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
<p>It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
    programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
    Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
